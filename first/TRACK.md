## Deploying v2 scheduled functions

Created a separate [repo](https://github.com/akauppi/cfv2-deploy-311022) to study and report the deployment problems.

- `firebase-functions` issues:

   - [ ] ["[Beta] Unable to deploy CF v2 scheduled function to `europe-north1`, `europe-west4` regions"](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-functions/issues/1293)

- Firebase CLI issues:
   - [ ] ["Deployment under Docker fails if firebase-debug.log is mapped to host"](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/5177)
