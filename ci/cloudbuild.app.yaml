# ci/cloudbuild.app.yaml
#
# Trigger:
#   - PR is made or changed; changes affect 'packages/app' or 'packages/app-deploy-ops' (or '/package.json', or 'tools/**')
#
# Cloud Build project:
#   - Common CI builder (not project specific; no deploys!)
#
# Uses images:
#   - node:16
#   - firebase-ci-builder   (pushed to Container Registry; used via Docker Compose)
#   - docker/compose
#
# Runtime environment:
#   - Current directory is '/workspace/...', based on the 'dir' field
#
#   - env.variables (just some):
#     PWD=/workspace
#     HOME=/builder/home
#
# Note:
#   Using 'node:16' to run 'npm install' means that the packages are installed as root, and 'node_modules' is read-only
#   to regular users (of other images). This is normally not a concern.

steps:
# Root install
#
- name: node:16
  entrypoint: npm
  args: ['install']

# --- Backend
#
# Do not care to test it - separate PR task does it.
#
- name: node:16
  entrypoint: npm
  args: ['install']
  dir: packages/backend

# --- App
#
- name: node:16
  entrypoint: npm
  args: ['install']
  dir: packages/app
  env: ['CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0']

# Launch emulators; keeps them running in the background.
#
# Note: Unlike in 'dev', no priming of data & users is needed. Cypress tests carry their own.

    # keep building such that 'sh' is enough (maybe 'ci:build' target if needed)

# Try that the code builds with fake access values.

timeout: 500s
