# ci/cloudbuild.backend.yaml
#
# Triggers:
#   - PR is made or changed; changes affect 'packages/backend' (or '/package.json')
#
# Cloud Build project:
#   - Common CI builder (not project specific; no deploys!)
#     https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=ci-builder
#
# Uses images:
#   - node:16-alpine
#   - firebase-ci-builder   (pushed to Container Registry)
#   - docker/compose
#
# Runtime environment:
#   - Current directory is '/workspace/...', based on the 'dir' field
#
#   - env.variables (just some):
#     PWD=/workspace
#     HOME=/builder/home
#
# Note:
#   Using 'node:16' to run 'npm install' means that the packages are installed as root, and 'node_modules' is read-only
#   to regular users (of other images). This is normally not a concern.
#

steps:
# Install
#
- name: node:16-alpine
  entrypoint: sh
  args: ['-c', '
    npm install &&
    npm --prefix packages/backend install
  ']

# WARNING!!!
#
#   If there is a problem with Cloud Functions, INSTEAD OF EXITING, THE EMULATORS KEEP RUNNING!! This is NOT
#   ideal for developers, because it gives the feeling things would be right. INSTEAD, FIREBASE EMULATORS SHOULD FAIL
#   if there is a major problem like Cloud Functions cannot be started. **PLEASE PUT PRESSURE ON FIREBASE TO CHANGE
#   THIS BEHAVIOUR if you agree with it.** Saves all of our time. Thank You.
#
#   ^-- Above applies only to the case where there would be failures INITIALLY, when the emulators are loaded.
#       In this case, I think emulators should refuse to launch. The emulators also have hot-reload capabilities
#       for functions and Rules, and for this use case, it's vital that they keep running.
