# ci/cloudbuild.master-pr.backend.yaml
#
# Triggers:
#   - PR is made or changed; changes affect 'packages/backend' (or '/package.json', or 'tools/**')
#
# Cloud Build project:
#   - Common CI builder (not project specific; no deploys!)
#
# Runtime environment:
#   - Current directory is '/workspace/...', based on the 'dir' field
#
#   - env.variables (just some):
#     PWD=/workspace
#     HOME=/builder/home
#
# Note:
#   Using 'node:16' to run 'npm install' means that the packages are installed as root, and 'node_modules' is read-only
#   to regular users (that other images may have). This is normally not a concern.
#

steps:
# Root install
#
- name: node:16
  entrypoint: npm
  args: ['install']

# Backend
#
- name: node:16
  entrypoint: npm
  args: ['install']
  dir: packages/backend

# Using native
#
#- name: gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/firebase-ci-builder:${_BUILDER_TAG}
#  entrypoint: npm
#  args: ['run', 'ci:test']
#  dir: packages/backend

# Using DC
#
- name: docker/compose:${_DOCKER_COMPOSE_TAG}
  args: ['run', 'test']
  dir: packages/backend
  env: [
    'CI_BUILDER_IMAGE=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/firebase-ci-builder:${_BUILDER_TAG}'
  ]

- name: node:16
  entrypoint: npm
  args: ['run', 'lint']
  dir: packages/backend
