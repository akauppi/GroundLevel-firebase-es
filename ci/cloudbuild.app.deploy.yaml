#
# ci/cloudbuild.app.deploy.yaml
#
# Triggers:
#   - new stuff is merged to a branch ('$BRANCH_NAME'); changes either in 'packages/app/**' or root 'package.json'.
#
# Cloud Build project:
#   Production/staging GCP project (deploys to itself).
#
# Responsibility:
#   - build and deploy front-end
#
# Uses images:
#   - node:{16|18}-alpine (stock image)
#   - firebase-emulators  (pushed to Artifact Registry)   contains Firebase CLI we use for deployment
#   - git                 (Cloud Build built-in image)
#   - gsutil              (Cloud Build built-in image)
#
# Runtime environment:
#   - Current directory is '/workspace/...', based on the 'dir' field
#
#   - env.variables (just some):
#     PWD=/workspace
#     HOME=/builder/home
#
# Manual triggering:
#   - Provide an SHA of a tested commit by '--substitutions=_TESTED_SHA=...'.
#
# References:
#   - Cloud Build > Substituting variable values
#     https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values
#
steps:
# Flight check
#
# - Using '${SHORT_SHA}' as an indicator, whether we are manually triggerred (empty) or in production CI (has stuff).
