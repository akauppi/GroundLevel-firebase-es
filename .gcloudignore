# NOTE: These are NOT observed by default by 'gcloud', and the '#!include' syntax does NOT allow paths in subdirectories.
#
# We can live with this. It's still nice to have '.gitignore' in the 'packages/*' subfolders, since they are so
# autonomous. They are the truth - list here should reflect them. If it doesn't, no big harm - just more stuff gets
# shipped at CI/CD builds.

# Unfortunately, 'roll/out/*' also wipes out the '.gitkeep' (and thus the folder). We compensate this by creating
# the folder in the root level (if CI run is involved).

# The '/branding/favicon.png' is needed, and since '.gcloudignore' doesn't seem to support exclusion by '!', we
# use the naming of other files in there.
