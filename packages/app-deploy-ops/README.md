# app-deploy

Takes the app developed in `../app` sister package and prepares it for operations.

Adds:

- `@ops/central` implementation that connects the app's logging calls to a cloud service
- crash reporting
- Firebase production initialization
  - bakes in Firebase access values

We get the application logic as a module dependency, and don't expect anything from it (apart from it needing Firebase initialized and an implementation for `@ops/central`). It can use any web framework, and any libraries.

### Adapters

Available integrations:

||adapters|comments|
|---|---|---|
|Performance monitoring|tbd.|
|Logging|[Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging)|
|Crash reporting|tbd.|

><font color=red>WARN: Adapters are still work-in-progress.</font>

>Note: You can use more than one adapter of a specific kind at any one time. This may be useful if evaluating vendors or transitioning between them.

### Relation to deployment

For this sub-package, you need to log in to a Firebase project (instructions below).

This project can be a staging project - you should only deal with the production instance via CI/CD. This allows you eg. to develop the operational wrapping, but often even being in this sub-package is not necessary: CI/CD takes your backend and app, and changes here are presumed to be rather rare.
-->


## Requirements

- npm

### Have the app built

```
$ (cd ../app && npm install && npm run build)
```

>‚ö†Ô∏è We don't set up a watch for the app folder. The latest build done there is picked up by `app-deploy`. If you change app sources, also rebuild it.

### Have staging prepared

See [Deployment to staging](../../README.md#deployment-to-staging) in the main `README.md`.

<!-- Editor's note:
The link above should work in GitHub; it doesn't work with the MacDown editor
-->

This means there's a `../../firebase.staging.js` file that contains the means to reach the backend:

```
const config = {
  "projectId": "testing-123",
  "appId": "...",
  "locationId": "...",
  "apiKey": "...",
  "authDomain": "testing-123.firebaseapp.com",
};
export default config;
```

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Build for deployment:

```
$ ENV=[production|staging|...] npm run build
...
created roll/out in 8.1s
```

### Try it out

```
$ npm run serve
...
i  hosting: Serving hosting files from: roll/out
‚úî  hosting: Local server: http://0.0.0.0:3012
...
```

Visit [http://localhost:3012](http://localhost:3012) and you should see a UI.


## Deploying

Deploying is intended to be done via CI/CD.

We'll cover that in `../../ci` but for now, you can do one deployment manually.

<details style="border: 1px solid lightblue; padding: 0.5em;"><summary>Manual deploying...</summary>

### Manual deploying (just in case..)

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/work -w /work -p 9005:9005 firebase-ci-builder:9.16.0-node16-npm7 /bin/bash
```

Within Docker:

```
# firebase login
...
Visit this URL on this device to log in:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=563584335869-...9005
```

Copy-paste the URL to a browser, visit it and sign in.

![](.images/firebase-login-wohoo.png)

Close the browser and return to the Docker.

```
# firebase use --add
```

Select the right project, give a fake alias (eg. `abc`), and you're in. 

>This is the state that CI/CD would normally operate in. You can now run commands intended for CI.

```
# npm run ci:build
...
worker in 370ms
...
@firebase/app (imported by src/main.js, adapters/cloudLogging/proxy.js)
@local/app (imported by src/main.js)
created roll/out in 575ms
```

>The CI build picks the activation values from the active project. It does not need a `../../firebase.{env}.js`.

If all went well, proceed with deployment:

```
# npm run ci:deploy
...

tbd. Above doesn't work: '../app' is not available for the Docker.

You can now try the web app at the URL shown on the console:

[https://&lt;<i>your project id</i>&gt;.web.app](https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.web.app)

The rest of this `README` discusses development of the `app-ops` operational layer. If you are not interested, you can skip it (proceed to `../../ops` and `../../ci`, in that case).

---

If you continue, we have a look at the adapter system and how you can develop them.

There are adapters for:

- performance monitoring
- central logging
- crash analytics

Let's first look at development commands in general, then peek at each of the adapter types, in particular.

## Development

### Watch mode

If you develop the integration part (code in `src/`), it may be useful to have the code automatically repackaged after changes.

```
$ npm run watch:roll
```

>Note: This might not have Hot Module Reload (as `app` development has). Just press Refresh on the browser.

<!-- contributions on setting up HMR for Rollup are welcome :) #help
-->

### Stats

It's good to keep an eye on the packaging sizes.

There are many Rollup packages for this, and the choices done in this repo may not be the best.

We have:

- `rollup-plugin-analyzer` showing the output sizes on every build
- `rollup-plugin-visualizer` creates `roll/stats.html` showing the same info in a graphical manner

>üí°: Please suggest your favourite plugins to the author; we can also think of stripping these completely away - it's a very personal thing and maybe best left for tools that visualize a directory already created (not needing to be part of the build setup).


<!--
## Performance monitoring

...tbd.
-->

## Logging

The logging adapters are added in this stage.

This is a very organization specific (or personal, if you are a one-person organization) choice. The reasons to pick a logging system might be:

1. **You already have one.** 

	There's no choice - you are told which one to use and how to use it.

2. **Integrations**

	It's part of your larger ops framework and you know a certain logging provider fits in well (to have alerts etc. function).

3. **The user interface**

	Logs are analyzed by people. The speed, ease of use and familiarity of the user interface matters, greatly!
	
	Don't burden yourself with a clumsy logging provider. Switch them! Compete them! We give you the means for that.

### Adapters

The GroundLevel central logging is based on adapters, allowing you to ship logs to or **or multiple** providers. You can eg. ship them both to the company standard logging provider, and a secondary one that you prefer for manual analysis.

You can create adapters yourself, and even publish and share them with others as npm packages.

>**Current state**
>
>The [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging) adapter is intended to be the initial one, but it's **work in progress** since Cloud Logging does not provide a browser facing logging client.
>
>Another nice one could be [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com).

## Final yards üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We've now covered *building* the backend, the front end and preparing the front end for deployment.

Next, you can check these two sub-folders in either order:

- [CI/CD](../../ci/README.md)

   Shows setting up a CI/CD pipeline, using [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build), for continuous testing and deployment.

- [Operations](../../ops/README.md)

   Discussion about the operational aspects of running an application. The contents are firmly connected to what's in this sub-package but more general and discussive in nature (thus they aren't here).


Getting your application deployed is simply the beginning of your journey. The author hopes that this repo helped you to get *there* fast. üòã 

<!--
But now what?

Have a look at the [ops](../../ops) folder. It has documentation about how one can build operational prowness on top of a running product.

Then... build features... test... deploy... monitor... üîÅ
-->

Be your bugs simple üêû and users friendly.
