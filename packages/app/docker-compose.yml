#
# For development (via 'npm run dev:local') and as a basis for CI.
#
# Docker compose of:
#   - Vite      front end Hot-Module Reloading; hosting
#
# Intentions:
#   Host and hot-module-reload the front end.
#
#   Cypress use is native (not within DC).
#
# Docker Compose (v3) note:
#   BE CAREFUL with use of pipe ('|') or '&&' in the commands! See -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/68590318/14455
