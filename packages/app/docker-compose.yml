# app/docker-compose.yml
#
# DC definition for 'npm run dev[:local]' and (via an overlay), for 'npm run dev:online'.
#
# Note:
#   DC overlays (using the same service name and loading multiple files with '-f') does not allow for REMOVAL of
#   eg. mounts, but it does allow concatenation to the mounts. Thus the common stuff is in here.
#
# Override:
#   PORT (3000|3001)
#   MODE ("local"|"online")
#
# Docker compose of:
#   - Vite      front end Hot-Module Reloading; hosting
#
# Intentions:
#   Host and hot-module-reload the front end.
#
# Docker Compose (v3) note:
#   BE CAREFUL with use of pipe ('|') or '&&' in the commands! See -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/68590318/14455
