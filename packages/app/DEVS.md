# Developer notes

## Peer problems when updating Vue

```
$ npm install
...
Found: @vue/compiler-sfc@3.0.5
npm ERR! node_modules/@vue/compiler-sfc
npm ERR!   peer @vue/compiler-sfc@"^3.0.4" from @vitejs/plugin-vue@1.1.4
npm ERR!   node_modules/@vitejs/plugin-vue
npm ERR!     dev @vitejs/plugin-vue@"^1.1.4" from the root project
npm ERR!   dev @vue/compiler-sfc@"^3.0.6" from the root project
...
```

If you run into such problems, remove the existing installation by:

```
$ rm -rf node_modules/@vue node_modules/vue
```

Try again.


## Cypress naming conventions

We're taking liberties naming the folders differently.

||us|Cypress default|
|---|---|---|
|tests|`cypress/<story>`|`cypress/integration`|
|commands|`cypress/commands`|`cypress/support`|

The `integration` just felt uncomfortable, since all our tests are integration tests. It doesn't add value.

Similarly, anything non-test is "support" but what the folder really carries are custom `cy.` commands.

Sorry about this. It's normally a good deed to follow a tool's conventions. It makes moving between projects easier, for one.

Let the author know if you feel strongly about this - or have a suggestion for a better naming convention!


## Firebase `--project` affects Cloud Functions

Only the project mentioned in the launch command gets Cloud Functions applied. The rest don't.

One can use eg. Firestore with any number of projects, on the same emulator instance but Cloud Functions background logic is only connected to the project named at the launch command.

>This behaviour isn't documented by Firebase. In fact, the author remembers seeing somewhere that the `--project` flag would "only affect hosting", but this is unconfirmed, without a source link.


## Clean up disk space from Cypress

Cypress cache gathers easily some weight.

```
du -d 1 -h ~/Library/Caches/Cypress/
783M	/Users/x/Library/Caches/Cypress//7.1.0
750M	/Users/x/Library/Caches/Cypress//7.5.0
777M	/Users/x/Library/Caches/Cypress//7.2.0
  0B	/Users/x/Library/Caches/Cypress//cy
761M	/Users/x/Library/Caches/Cypress//7.6.0
3,0G	/Users/x/Library/Caches/Cypress/
```

When new versions come available, they pile up here.

To reclaim disk space, just remove the unneeded folders.

>Note: Moving to trash bin does not clear the space. `rm -rf` does. ;)

You can also use:

```
$ npx cypress cache prune

Deleted all binary caches except for the 7.6.0 binary cache.
```

## Building the Docker image, after it's changed

`docker compose` doesn't track changes to the Dockerfile defined with `build:`, by purpose.

To reflect changes, use:

```
$ docker compose build
```

>If you change a serviceâ€™s Dockerfile or the contents of its build directory, run docker-compose build to rebuild it. <sub>source: [Docker Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/build/)</sub>
