## Cypress will provide means to config what gets cleared, between tests üêå

Until it does, we have work-arounds in `cypress/support`.

- [Cypress should clear indexeddb state between test runs](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1208)

- [Enable Lifecycle Events to be customizable](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/686) (I did not read it all) states that "clear all" should be the default, but what gets cleared is to be made configurable.

Currently (5.3.0), Cypress does not clear IndexedDB storage and therefore Firebase log-ins are persistent, over tests.

Once there is a way to configure this (instead of code), we might prefer that.

## ESLint: top level await support pending "stage 4"

We'd like the ESlint error for top level await (e.g. in `local/init.js`) to be configured out, without bringing in Babel parser.

Like here: [Enable Top Level Await](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13178) (GitHub issues; closed)

- Track: [ECMAscript proposal: Top-level await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await) (GitHub) for reaching stage 4. 

   - [ ] Once there, find an issue at ESLint to track.

In "stage 3" (26 Oct 2020; Jan 2021).

In "stage 4" (Aug 2021). Will be in ESLint 8.0.

## Rollup-plugin-vue for Vue.js 3 (beta) needs an extra plugin for CSS/Sass

[https://github.com/vuejs/rollup-plugin-vue/issues/364](https://github.com/vuejs/rollup-plugin-vue/issues/364)

Needed to add the `rollup-plugin-scss` to `package.json` and `rollup.*.js`.

If they react on the issue, we can remove the extra plugin.

<_!--
This would seemingly help with rollup-plugin-vue [#364](https://github.com/vuejs/rollup-plugin-vue/issues/364) and thus with us not needing to load a plugin.

## Vite and `lang="scss"`

If you use `lang="scss"` in the `style` sections, this occurs:

```
$ npm run build
...
[vite:css] Preprocessor dependency "sass" not found. Did you install it?
```

- [ ] What is Vite official stand on this? Should `lang="scss"` support be built-in?

> Still there, with Vite 2.9.8. 


## `import` of JSON in browser

- Track [proposal-json-modules](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules) (tc39 proposal)
   - [ ]¬†reaching stage 4 (stage 3 in May 2022)
   - [ ] being implemented in browsers

Might take a while. 

Once available on modern browsers, consider movig the Firebase config reading (in prod) to use this???

## `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to have better ESM support

At May 2022, the [`package.json`](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer/blob/master/package.json) does not have an `exports` section.

Having one might help us use it, within the `build` DC task.

Background:

We need to install it globally (`-g`), since the `/work/node_modules` is read-only and installing to `/node_modules` is not allowed, by Node.js.

>Tried a work-around of making `/work/2` and then we can use `--prefix ..`, but that's kind of over-complicating things.


## Safari: not showing errors within a top-level `await`

Version: Safari 15.5

- [ ]¬†tbd. look for an issue to track / create one?

The Safari 15 browser shows NO ERROR IN CONSOLE OUTPUT if an error happens within a top-level `await` block.

Sample (in a JavaScript file):

```
await (async function () {
  no_such_thing;
})();
```

**Expected**

An error would be logged in console, when this is executed.

Chrome 102 shows this:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: no_such_thing is not defined
at main.js:109:3
    at main.js:111:3
```    

**Actual**

No error. The script silently stops executing at the `await`.

**Outcome**

DO NOT use top-level `await` in browser code, for now.
