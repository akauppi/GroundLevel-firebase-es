# Known issues


## Browser window is all empty

If, after `npm run dev`, there's nothing in the browser and the console shows:

`Unable to load module .. app.js`

..or something, nothing's necessarily wrong.

**Remedy #1**

Clear cache, refresh the browser.

**Remedy #2**

Try with multiple browsers. E.g. Chrome may give more debugging information than Safari.


## Priming fails with: `socket hang up. Error code: ECONNRESET` 

Created [#104](https://github.com/akauppi/GroundLevel-firebase-es/issues/104) to track this.

*Still having this, on Windows 10 + WSL (13-Jul-2022)* 

*Also on macOS /28-Jul-2022*

```
$ npm test
...
Firebase Emulators for the web app are running.

>Can also happen with `npm run dev`.

If you encounter this, just retry.

The reason is unknown. 


## `ERROR:gpu_memory_buffer_support_x11.cc [...] dri3 extension not supported`

..when running `make test`.

```
[192:1004/121659.646969:ERROR:gpu_memory_buffer_support_x11.cc(44)] dri3 extension not supported.
```

You can ignore this line. It's likely connected with Chrome (and headed mode, not headless). Does not affect us.


## Warnings in `make test` output

```
[2022-10-05T15:07:25.368Z]  @firebase/database: FIREBASE WARNING: Using an unspecified index. Your data will be downloaded and filtered on the client. Consider adding ".indexOn": "ctx/clientTimestamp" at /incoming/incs to your security rules for better performance. 
```

The `../backend/database.rules.app.json` file should have appropriate indexing, but emulators don't seem to load it.

**This warning can be ignored.**
