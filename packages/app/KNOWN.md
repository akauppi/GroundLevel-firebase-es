# Known issues


## Browser window is all empty

If, after `npm run dev`, there's nothing in the browser and the console shows:

`Unable to load module .. app.js`

..or something, nothing's necessarily wrong.

**Remedy #1**

Clear cache, refresh the browser.

**Remedy #2**

Try with multiple browsers. E.g. Chrome may give more debugging information than Safari.


## Priming fails with: `socket hang up. Error code: ECONNRESET` 

Created [#104](https://github.com/akauppi/GroundLevel-firebase-es/issues/104) to track this.

*Still having this, on Windows 10 + WSL (13-Jul-2022)* 

*Also on macOS /28-Jul-2022*

>Can also happen with `npm run dev`.

If you encounter this, just retry.

The reason is unknown.
