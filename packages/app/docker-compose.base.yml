#
# app/docker-compose.base.yml
#
# Base for 'docker-compose{local|online}.yml
#
# Note:
#   DC overlays (using the same service name and loading multiple files with '-f') does not allow for REMOVAL of
#   eg. mounts, but it does allow concatenation to the mounts. Thus the common stuff is in here.
#
# Note 2:
#   Docker Compose checks for use of $SOME substitutions in _all_ of the services in the DC files (not the ones used
#   for starting a task/service). This means it's best to have this separate from the main 'docker-compose.yml'
#   (makes use of '$PORT' have less side effects).
#
# Expects:
#   PORT with a number to a free port (e.g. 3000)
#
# Override:
#   MODE ("local"|"online")
#
# Docker compose of:
#   - Vite      front end Hot-Module Reloading; hosting
#
# Intentions:
#   Host and hot-module-reload the front end.
#
# Docker Compose (v3) note:
#   BE CAREFUL with use of pipe ('|') or '&&' in the commands! See -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/68590318/14455
