## 25-Apr-2021

- **FIX:** Vue.js 3 Developer Tools enabled (without official documentation)
- **FIX:** Cypress tests Back Functional!!
- **FIXED:** signing in/out in `LOCAL` mode; `user=` only needed for the initial page

## 8-Jan-2021

- Upgraded to Vite 2.0 (beta)

  - speeds up development (no sign-in dialog)
  - allows completely offline development (no reference to any cloud project)

- `npm run dev:online` works again
- Using `RColl`/`RDoc` for Firestore listening (great!)
- Using `import` for Firebase and FirebaseUI
  - NOTE: <font color=red>This DOES NOT FULLY WORK YET!</font> Track in [FirebaseUI: "updateCurrentUser failed" dialog after importing as ES module](https://github.com/akauppi/GroundLevel-es-firebase-app/issues/1)
- Revised `README` to match latest developments (eg. running tests)
  - Split in two, since it has grown and don't know what to cut away.
