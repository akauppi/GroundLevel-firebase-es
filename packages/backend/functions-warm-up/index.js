* Warm up the Cloud Functions.

* Context:
*   Launched ** from the Cloud Functions themselves ** when they are loaded to Functions Emulator.
*
* Note:
*   This module is run _before_ the emulator claims it is ready by opening port 4000. ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒž
*
*   This is all very EXPERIMENTAL. Ideally, Firebase Emulators would offer an option to wake up all Cloud Functions,
*   before the emulators are announced ready by opening the 4000 port!

* 1. Write a priming project
* 2. Write info about a person to 'userInfo'
*   These two steps need to be separate, since the Cloud Function observes writes against already existing projects.
* 3. Observe that the userInfo is reflected in the project.
*
* Notes:
*   - When this is run, the database is empty. The emulators just started.
*   - The only reason we need the priming project is to time, how long it takes before the change has happened
*     (just writing a dummy would wake up the Cloud Function).
*   - Whatever we write, the tests will wipe it away (we won't be able to affect the tests).
