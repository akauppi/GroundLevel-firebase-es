# Back-end

Back-end features for GroundLevel sample application.

Responsible for:

- implementation and documentation of the back-end
   - data structures
   - access rights
   - database back-end processes 
   - proxying to Cloud Logging (ops)
- testing the back-end


## Requirements

- Node 14 or 16
- `npm` >= 7.7.0

   >`npm` 7 is needed for the way we refer between subpackages (`file://`). For Node 14, please update to `npm` 7.

- Docker Desktop

<!-- 
developed with:
- macOS 11.4
- node 16.2
- npm 7.19

- Docker Desktop 3.3.4 with: 1 CPU core, 1.5 GB RAM
-->

### Docker settings

Using Docker makes launching Firebase Emulators a little bit (5..7 s) slower than if they were run natively. However, you don't need to restart the emulators that often, so this is deemed as tolerable.

<!-- 13..16 vs. 8..9 s (on macOS) 
-->

>If you experience time-outs with the tests, see [DEVS/Docker Performance.md](../../DEVS/Docker%20Performance.md).


## Getting started

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ npm test
```

The tests should pass, or be skipped.

## Development workflow

```
$ npm start
```

This launches the Firebase emulator in one terminal, and automatically picks up changes to the sources.

You can then run individual tests against it (see `package.json` for the precise name of commands).

e.g. 

```
$ npm run test:fns:userInfo
```

## Alternative: use native `firebase-tools`

The above instructions require you to have Docker running.

If you rather develop with Firebase CLI (globally installed), use these commands:

```
$ npm run ci:test   # instead of 'npm test'
$ npm run ci:start  # instead of 'npm start'
```

## Deploying

Actual deploying is expected to be done via Continuous Integration. See `ci` at the repo root.
