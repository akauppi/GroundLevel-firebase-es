# docker-compose.app.yml
#
# A version of the DC definition for front-end development and testing.
#
# Note:
#   Was unable to override definitions on 'docker-compose.yml' and have both this and the backend 'emul'
#   runnable at the same time. Doing a full rewrite adds a bit to maintenance (not DRY), but also makes
#   things way simpler: the 'docker-compose.yml' is now only for the backend and its CI.
