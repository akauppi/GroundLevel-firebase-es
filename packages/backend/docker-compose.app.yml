# docker-compose.app.yml
#
# A version of the DC definition for front-end development and testing.
#
# Expects:
#   'FUNCTIONS_PORT'  ! EXPERIMENTAL; still looking which is the best way to pass the port numbers..
#
# Note:
#   Ports exposed at the host are defined so that they do not overlap with those of 'docker-compose.yml'.
#   This means backend containers can be left running while doing front-end development.
