#
# docker-compose.yml
#
# For development (via 'npm' scripts) and as a basis for CI.
#
# Docker compose of:
#   - firebase-ci-builder   brings Firebase Emulators
#   - data and user priming
#
# Environment:
#   - CI_BUILDER_IMAGE (optional); name of the builder image.
#
# Intentions:
#   Within a Docker universe,
#     - launch Firebase Emulators using 'firebase.json' (UI could be disabled);
#       - exposing ports for Firestore and Firebase Auth (Cloud Functions emulated but not used from the front end)
#
# Docker Compose (v3) note:
#   BE CAREFUL with use of pipe ('|') or '&&' in the commands! See -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/68590318/14455
