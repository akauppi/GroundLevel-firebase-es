#
# docker-compose.yml
#
# For development (via 'npm' scripts) and as a basis for CI.
#
# Docker compose of:
#   - firebase-ci-builder   brings Firebase Emulators
#   - data and user priming
#
# Environment:
#   - CI_BUILDER_IMAGE (optional); name of the builder image.
#
# Intentions:
#   Within a Docker universe,
#     - launch Firebase Emulators using 'firebase.json' (UI could be disabled);
#       - exposing ports for Firestore and Firebase Auth (Cloud Functions emulated but not used from the front end)
#
# Docker Compose (v3) note:
#   BE CAREFUL with use of pipe ('|') or '&&' in the commands! See -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/68590318/14455

  # WARM UP the engines!!!
  #
  # Firebase Emulators are SLOW to wake. This part runs a minimal set of tests (the results of which are not used),
  # to wake up the necessary subsystems server-side. This results in more dependable test times in the actual tests.
  #
  # Once warmed up, 'socat' is used to open a TCP connection. Just the existence of this connection is enough to
  # signal to the tests that they can be started.
