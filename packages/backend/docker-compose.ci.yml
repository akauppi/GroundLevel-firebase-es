# backend/docker-compose.ci.yml
#
# Takes the role of both 'dc.base.yml' and 'docker-compose.yml', for CI.
# Works as a basis for 'docker-compose.app.ci.yml'.
#
# Reasons:
#   - in CI, we don't need separate emulator instances for backend and front-end (same can handle both)
#   - in CI, we always run on Linux, so don't need the 'tmp/functions-node_modules' tricks, done in development (simpler)
#   - !! separating development and CI causes some overlap, but also frees the implementations from breaking each other!!
#   - uses a pre-built image instead of pointing to '../dc/', as development does.
#
# Expects:
#   CI_BUILDER_IMAGE  to provide the name of the Docker image to use
#
services:
  emul:
    # Note: Could use the repo's '/dc' folder. In this case, no prior push to 'ci-builder' is needed.

    #  file: ../../dc/firebase-emulators/base.yml

    image: ${CI_BUILDER_IMAGE}

    # Ports not needed; tests will run directly against 'emul' (or 'emul-for-app') hostname.
