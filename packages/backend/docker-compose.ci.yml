#
# docker-compose.ci.yml
#
# An override for using 'docker-compose.yml' in Cloud Build
#
# Intentions:
#   Allow the 'docker-compose.yml' file be used, from Cloud Build scripts,
#   so that the services are available to the following steps (using 'cloudbuild' network).
#
# References:
#   - Share Compose configurations between files and projects (Docker Compose docs)
#     -> https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/
