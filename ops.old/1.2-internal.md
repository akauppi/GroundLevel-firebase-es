# 1.2 Internal probing

Internal probes are developer-focused tools that the user should not be aware of / bothered with. They provide a means to validate that the performance or other assumptions made in the safety of the development computers are also valid with the wider userbase.

It allows finding outliers, and improving their user experience. This way, it benefits the users as well.

## What gets automatically collected?

The sample front-end has some elementary samples for collecting timings. These might change from release to release (as may your own probes), so they are not listed here.

Have a look at them at:

- [`packages/app/src/central/counters.js`](../packages/app/src/central/counters.js)
- [`packages/app/src/central/logs.js`](../packages/app/src/central/logs.js)

<!-- tbd. histograms -->


## What do I need to code?

You can remove or modify the provided samples, and make your own in the same pattern.
