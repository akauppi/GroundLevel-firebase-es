# Roadmap ðŸ—º

The author has some ideas on when the repo would be "done". ðŸ™‚


## Interactive browser-to-browser comms 

There are many web apps that function as browser-to-browser real-time games. This is fascinating, and the demo app should showcase using such services.

- Picking suitable backend
- Showing how to set it up
- Client side use

## Graphics

Interactive SVG Graphics.

The author loves this, and wants to do it with Svelte. Whether such work ends up being part of this repo, is another issue. Perhaps not - it may be best leveraged as web components.

## Keeping up-to-date with repo improvements

This would be Big.

Instead of taking a version of the repo and using it as a basis for one's app, one should be able to "subscribe" to improvements (eg. updates to emulators).

This means the repo would not only iron out the *initial* cost of setting up an environment, but also the *ongoing* cost of keeping it current. It would also encourage *commonly improving the template*.

Can this be done??

The thinking is that:

- app specific things would live in Git subpackages (different changelogs)
- the main repo can then `git pull` to remain up-to-date
-->

This will need experimenting with 2..3 application authors willing to put effort into this.
