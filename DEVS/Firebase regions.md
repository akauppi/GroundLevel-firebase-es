# Firebase regions <sup>[1]</sup>

<small>`[1]`: Also called "locations"</small>

The Firebase regions story is not quite simple, and has evolved over time.

Originally, it seems, Firebase Realtime Database only "lived" in `us-central1`, one single region.

Cloud Functions and Cloud Firestore, pushing for more cloud scale scalability, introduced more regions.

In 2022, also Realtime Database can be hosted in other regions than `us-central1`, but [only a few](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#rtdb-locations).

When one creates a Firebase project (either Cloud Functions, Cloud Firestore or Realtime Database), one needs to select a location (region) for it. It would be simple if this was a single choice, but it's not.

Thus the need to look into it. We're trying to answer two questions:

- Which region(s) should I run my backend in?
- How to set it up?

>Note: Once Firebase resources are created, the choice is set. You cannot modify the region/location any more.
>
>If you wish to experiment with another setup, just create a new project (unless you have user data in there, which... we're not covering transitioning such to another region).


## Check the Docs

Let's first read what Firebase has to say about this. Read the referenced documents (and of page) *in full!!* and then return here. :)

[Select locations for your project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations) states:

- There is a *default GCP resource location* 

   >This location is where your data is stored for GCP services that require a location setting.

  <table>
  <tr><td>Steers:</td><td>Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage and Cloud Firestore scheduled functions</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Does not steer:</td><td>Cloud Firestore regular functions, Realtime Database</td></tr>
  </table>


## Regional capabilities

Firebase docs list regions per product, but don't provide a good list per region (which is helpful for deciding, which one you'd pick). Here we go.

><small>`[2]`: other than scheduled functions</small>

><small>`[3]`: `us-central1` (Iowa) and `europe-west1` (Belgium), the locations for hosting Realtime Database, aren't listed as a regional "GCP resources" targets, at all. They are offered as Multi-region services, however.</small>

## How to select?

Pick something that's close to your users. The Firebase documentation puts names of cities to the regions, to help you decide.

**Regional**

Regional would suffice fine. Multi-region is for more 9's at the end of the SLA - and costs more, accordingly.

**Tier 1 and 2**

That affects pricing, but the difference might not be that noticable.

**Legislation (GDPR et.al.)**

Let's say you'd prefer your user's data to always remain within a certain legal boundary, e.g. the EU.

- `europe-west1` is Belgium (EU), but not available as a regional service
- `europe-west2` is London (UK; non-EU)
- `europe-west3` is Frankfurt (EU)
- `europe-west6` is Z√ºrich (non-EU) <sub>The author is not aware if Switzerland would be a valid storage area, with the GDPR in mind.</sub>

This leaves only `europe-west3` (Frankfurt) ticking all the boxes.

For Realtime Database (only used for operational monitoring), you can pick `europe-west1` (Belgium).

<!-- hiss
>It's somewhat worrying that only a single region would tick the boxes, for GDPR. Maybe Google's thought is that if such things matter, the organization also wants to use multi-region (`eur3`).
-->

## What are we omitting?

Two things.

### Regional functions

Cloud Functions (except for scheduled ones) can be run in multiple regions. These are called "regional functions" and you can read about them in the Firebase documentation.

>Note: This repo doesn't do that, to keep things simple. Instead, Cloud Functions are always deployed in the "default GCP resources" location where also Cloud Firestore is running.
>
>If you want to run Cloud Functions in multiple regions, that's fine. You'll just code the functions accordingly, and need to tune the deployment scripts to your liking.


### Multi-region

Multi-region deployments add the service's **monthly** uptime target from 99.99% (max. 4.3 min downtime) to 99.999% (max. 26s downtime) <sub>[source](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/locations#sla)</sub>.

In reality, the downtimes are likely much less.

>Check out [Google Cloud > Service health](https://status.cloud.google.com/regional/europe) to see how their services are doing. 
>
>There's also `View history` at the bottom, to get an idea about the frequency and duration of historic incidents that affected service availability.


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I know what I want - how to set it up?

Firebase Console asks you to select a location when creating the services (Cloud Firestore / Cloud Functions and separately, Realtime Database).

Just do that. The repo will sniff your setup automatically, and deploy to the right destination.
