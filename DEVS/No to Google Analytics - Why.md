# No to Google Analytics - but why?

First, you *can* use Google Analytics with this repo if you want to. We'll go through when this could be meaningful, and why the default does not require it.


## Choice at Create project

>![](.images/no-to-analytics.png)

Firebase presents you with the above choice when creating a project. It "recommends" enabling Google Analytics.

The question is: does this benefit *you* as a web app author - or your users, in any way?

The `(?)` icons provide guidence on what *features* you are missing, but the dialog does not tell:

- what data does Google Analytics collect from your web app's users?
- where is this data being used?

Because of this uncertainty -- and reluctance to decide something on behalf of others -- this repo is not using the services mentioned here as depending on Google Analytics.

Instead:

- Learning about users is done using [Plausible](https://plausible.io) - who especially underline their dedication to users' freedom to value privacy.

- A/B testing is not yet (Jul 2022) implemented in the repo, but can be.

- Crash monitoring is implemented by [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/).

   >Note: Firebase Crashlytics would anyways not be available for web apps (Jul 2022).

## When would you use Google Analytics?

>Disclaimer: The author has no experience on Google Analytics. Take with  ðŸ§‚.

- [ ] If your application shows ads
- [ ]Â If you already are using the product, and are familiar with it

In such a case, go right ahead but realize you're on your own!
