# No to Google Analytics - but why?

>![](.images/no-to-analytics.png)

When creating a Firebase project, you are faced with this dialog (the switch is `enable` by default).

By *not* enabling it, you say bye-bye to:

- A/B testing (รก la Firebase)
- Crashlytics (if ever it would support web apps, which it doesn't)

How does this setting affect your web app's users?

I don't. Know.

- See [Google Analytics](https://www.techtarget.com/searchbusinessanalytics/definition/Google-Analytics) (article; Apr 2021)

The Firebase console page (screenshot above) does not mention what pros or cons enabling the setting would bring. It all feels a bit fish(ing)y, and the author does not wish to burden the template with this time of stuff.

Thus. Keep it disabled, unless you *know* what you need it for and what compromises it does to your web app users.

Google's great. Ads not so much.

But they need a living like the rest of us.
