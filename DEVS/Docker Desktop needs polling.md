## Docker Desktop for Mac - host side file changes not seen in the container

- [ ] Try removing `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` at some point. `#later`
- [ ] If works, comment that (and suggest closing) issue 1802, below.

---

>This is more of a "documented" and "works as intended" issue. Chokidar needs `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` under "non-standard" networking conditions which Docker Desktop file sharing seems to be.
>
>So: nothing to see, but listing the issues anyhow, 'cause they are interesting..
>
>Note: If polling becomes a problem, there are ways to work around it, but for now this is "closed".

### Our check (Alpine)

Make a folder (e.g. `Temp/def`).

```
$ cd Temp/def
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/work -w /work node:16-alpine sh

# apk add inotify-tools

# inotifywait -rme modify,attrib,move,close_write,create,delete,delete_self /work
...
Watches established.
```

Create or change files in the folder - on the (Mac) host.

**Expected**

- Some output within Docker, reflecting on the changes

**Actual**

- (empty)


### Our check (Debian)

Just so it wouldn't be Alpine specific, let's see:

You can use the same folder (e.g. `Temp/def`).

```
$ cd Temp/def
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/work -w /work debian:latest bash

# apt-get update
# apt-get install inotify-tools

# inotifywait -rme modify,attrib,move,close_write,create,delete,delete_self /work
...
Watches established.
```

**Behaviour**

Same as above (Alpine), so seems not Linux flavour specific.


### What works

- Docker Desktop on Windows doesn't seem to be affected
- not tested on native Linux; assuming things work

### What didn't work

- In `packages/backend`, changes to `functions/**` or `firestore.rules` require the emulators to be restarted.

   Normally, the emulators would print information on their output about changed files, and adjust accordingly.
   
- In `packages/app`, Hot Module Reloading is lost if Vite runs under Docker.

	This is ðŸ’” since we really need HMR to work. Cannot use DC for Vite until this is solved, one way or another.
