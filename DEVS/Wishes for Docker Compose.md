## Ability to set `--abort-on-container-exit` in the YAML

It would be nice to provide a developer experience where `docker compose up` just launches the "right things".

To do this, and not give up robustness, I would need to be able to defined *in the YAML file* that the CLI option `--abort-on-container-exit` should be applied, if `docker compose up` is launched, without any parameters.

## Docker Desktop for Mac vs. Windows (user handling on mapped volume writes)

>*This is slightly old. Not sure if the situation remains.*

With macOS, the experience is seamless.

One can share local files with `volumes:` and changes made to them within the container's code are seen as if a local user did it.

This is *not* the case with Windows 10 + WSL2.

There:

- writing to shared files fails, since the local user isn't the WSL2 host user. 
- if running as root (*? within the container, one presumes?*), writes need `sudo` on the host side

**Ideally..**

Behaviour of Docker Compose volume sharing would not be system specific (the macOS behaviour would be always there). This is the "least surprises" way.

**Quick fix:**

Add `user: '1000'` to the service description. This makes the containerized code run with the same UID as the WSL2 host user has.

This *does not* meddle with the macOS behavior.

How it works with Linux native Docker hasn't been tried, yet.

Problem with the quick fix is that it adds unnecessary "magic" to the `docker-compose.yml` file. We just "know" that 1000 is the WSL2 user id - and that it doesn't harm macOS. Fragile.

>In practise, the author didn't resort to this. Instead, Docker images run as `root`, not having users within them.

*Applies to Docker v. 20.10.7 on both the platforms.*

## Explicit mounting of a file üåπ

Mounting of files in DC `volumes` is possible, but demands the file system entry to exist, as a file, before the `docker compose` call.

This is the same for both normal (`volume`) mounts and `bind` mounts<sup>DC 2.6.1; Docker Desktop for Mac 4.10.1</sup>. The difference is:

- `volume` mounts quietly create a folder, unless a file exists host-side
- `bind` mounts print out an error and fail:

   ```
   invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist: ...
   ```

This causes us to have these preventive measures in `package.json` - or `Makefile`:

```
    "postinstall": "npm run -s _touchEm",
    "_touchEm": "touch firebase-debug.log firestore-debug.log ui-debug.log",
```

These are output files, normally created by Firebase Emulator. Now we must make sure they exist, so they won't be mapped as folders, instead.

**Suggestion**

Add a `:f` as a postfix, concatenable with others (in our case, we'd use `:delegated,f`).<sup>[1]</sup>

<small>`[1]`: DC already allows concatenating postfixes by `,`.</small>

## Automatically rebuild if the definition cascade has changed

>*We have counter-acted this by use of Makefiles.*

Docker Compose declarations allow referring to other declarations by:

- `extends: file: [service:]`   between Docker Compose definitions
- `build: context: [target:]`   uses a Dockerfile

**Problem**

If one uses the above linkages, then starts a task with `docker compose run`, further changes to the declarations are not taken into effect.

One needs to manually `docker compose build` the topmost service the `run` uses.

This causes confusion for the developer.

**Example**

I wanted to update the version of Vite defined in `packages/app/tools/vite.dc/Dockerfile`.

Editing it, and restarting the DC `run` left some earlier version in effect. Luckily, this is obvious in the particular tool's console output.

Dependency tree:

```
npm run dev
  --> uses `docker-compose.local.yml` with:
      extends:
        file: dc.base.yml
        service: vite-base
     --> `dc.base.yml`:
        build:
          context: tools/vite.dc
          target: vite_plain
         -->
            ARG VITE_VER=3.0.2    # the line that changes
```

**Suggested solution**

When doing `docker compose up` or `docker compose run`, Docker should consider *direct* extension chain, all the way to Dockerfiles. If it *knows* that something in the definitions has changed, it would:

- automatically rebuild what's needed
- or: warn that something has needed, and suggest using a flag to rebuild

>Note: This suggestion should be simple to implement (and cause no breaking changes) since no *interim* (and maybe running) image definitions are involved. Just the target the user explicitly states.

## Substitutions, within YAML

Docker Compose definitions handle environment variables in two levels:

||substitutions|environment|
|---|---|---|
|steers|Parsing the declaration|Commands run within DC|
|syntax|`$SOME`|`$$SOME`|
|comes from|Launching environment: `SOME=abc docker compose ...`|`environments:` section|

Docker Compose definitions lack a feature that e.g. Cloud Build definitions (unrelated, of course, but similar) have: [Substituting variable values](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values) (Cloud Build docs).

These can be used for:
- providing constant values in one place
- steering things build-time when the base declaration is extended

### Example

We use `/dc/firebase-emulators/base.yml` as a base definition for any use of Firebase emulators. It defines the version and launch command, but the project id comes from "above" (in practise, it's either `demo-2` or `demo-main`).

**What we currently do:**

```
  # Expects:
  #   - Derived declaration to provide 'PROJECT_ID' env.var. ('demo-...').
  #
  #     Such project's data is visible in the emulator UIs. ALSO OTHER PROJECT ID's (or no id) will work, but leaving
  #     the UI out of the loop.
  #
  base:
    build:
      context: ../firebase-tools
      target: firebase-emulators
      args:
        - FIREBASE_TOOLS_VERSION=11.13.0

    # 'ports', 'volumes', 'working_dir' to be provided by downstream

    command: sh -c
      'echo "Launching Docker... üê≥" &&
      ([ ! -z $${PROJECT_ID:-} ] || ( >&2 echo "ERROR. Missing ''PROJECT_ID'' env.var. (e.g. ''PROJECT_ID=demo-x'')"; false )) &&
      
      firebase emulators:start --project=$${PROJECT_ID:-}
        | grep -v -E "You are not currently authenticated|Detected demo project ID|You are not signed in to the Firebase CLI"
      '
```

**What we could do:**

```
  # Expects:
  #   - Derived declaration to provide 'PROJECT_ID' substitution ('demo-...').
  #
  #     Such project's data is visible in the emulator UIs. ALSO OTHER PROJECT ID's (or no id) will work, but leaving
  #     the UI out of the loop.
  #
  base:
    build:
      context: ../firebase-tools
      target: firebase-emulators
      args:
        - FIREBASE_TOOLS_VERSION=11.13.0

    # 'ports', 'volumes', 'working_dir' to be provided by downstream

    command: sh -c
      'echo "Launching Docker... üê≥" &&
      
      firebase emulators:start --project=${PROJECT_ID}
        | grep -v -E "You are not currently authenticated|Detected demo project ID|You are not signed in to the Firebase CLI"
      '
```

Benefits:

- no need to check for `PROJECT_ID` to exist: Docker Compose will err if it's omitted
- better suits the intention; this is a *build time* parameter


**Work-arounds:**

- Use env.vars at the build command

   We can use substitutions, as long as *each* build command does `PROJECT_ID=demo-main docker compose ...` when building.
   
   Having the substitution in the deriving definition would simply be a more appropriate place. 


**Implementation suggestions**

- 1. Adding `extends: substitutions` (or similar)

   This would be akin to how - when refering from Docker Compose definitions to Dockerfile's - we can already use `build: args` (see above for an example).

   ```
   emul-for-app:
     extends:
       file: dc.base.yml
       service: emul-base
       substitutions:          # SUGGESTION; NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE
         - PROJECT_ID=demo-main
   ```

   This would cater for the extension use case, but not allow "constants" to be used, within a single Docker Compose definition file.

- 2. Adding `substitutions` (or similar)

   Any Docker Compose file in the chain (or a single one) could have:
   
   ```
   substitutions:
     - PROJECT_ID=demo-main
   ```
   
   These should not affect "downstream" (if B extends A, defining a substitution Z in A would not have it defined in B. Defininf it in B would set Z in A).   
   
   This mechanism would be akin `substitutions` in Cloud Build definitions, as mentioned earlier.
