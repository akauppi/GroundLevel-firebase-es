# 1.1 Performance monitoring

## Questions to ask

With performance monitoring in place, you can answer questions such as:

|||
|---|---|
|**Userbase**|
|- how many users does the application have?|
|- where are they from, geographically?|
|- how many are frequent users?|
|- is the the number of active users increasing, or declining?|
|**Application health**|
|- is the application behaving as expected?|
|- if there are deviations, what kind of OS / browser / connection / geography are those connected to?|
|**Instrumentation**|
|- is a certain code block functioning on the field, as expected?|
|- how many users enter into a certain state / do a specific action (or chain of actions)?|

<!--
The last question may be useful e.g. if considering to deprecate or change some features - does anyone even use them?
-->

We'll compare the two tools below, based on these questions.


## What gets collected?

The JS clients pick up certain things automatically:

- Web Vitals ([Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/page-load-traces), [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/web-vitals/))
   - First Paint
   - First Contentful Paint
   - Cumulative Layout Shift
   - Largest Contentful Paint
   - First Input Delay (requires a polyfill for Firebase Performance Monitoring) 

- Network call response times ([Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/network-traces?platform=web))


## Firebase Performance Monitoring

[Firebase Performance Monitoring](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon)

Firebase Performance Monitoring is available for web applications, and there's no reason *not to* use it. However, when compared with exclusively  monitoring-focused tools (like Sentry), it leaves a somewhat bland impression.

Let's see how we can find answers to the above mentioned questions, using it.

||Firebase&nbsp;use|
|---|---|
|**Userbase**|
|- how many users does the application have?|*did not find this (May 22)*|
|- where are they from, geographically?|`Performance` > `View metric details` > `Country`<sup>[1]</sup>|
|- how many are frequent users?|*did not find this (May 22)*|
|- is the the number of active users increasing, or declining?|*did not find this (May 22)*|
|**Application health**|
|- is the application behaving as expected?|`Performance` main page.  `Select a metric` for the ones you want to track.|
|- if there are deviations, what kind of OS / browser / connection / geography are those connected to?|`View metric details` > filter by `Browser`, `Country`, `Effective connection type`, ...|
|**Instrumentation**|
|- is a certain code block functioning on the field, as expected?|`Performance` > `Custom traces` > (trace name) > `Duration`|
|- how many users enter into a certain state / do a specific action (or chain of actions)?|*as above* > `count`|

<sup>[1]</sup> You'll get a *sampling* of the users' geographies here, but not precise stats. Also, this is likely not meant for answering the question.


**Verdict**

While the Firebase Performance Monitoring dashboard *looks good* (May 2022), it doesn't *feel right*. It's as if the mindset of the tool is different from what I'm trying to fetch out of it. It knows more than it will easily share.


|||
|---|---|
|**Pros**|&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the Firebase ecosystem|
|**Cons**|&nbsp;&nbsp;Dashboard feeling is "nah" <sub>(can be improved in announced June 2022 update)</sub>|



## Sentry

Product Guides > [Performance Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/)

Same questions:

||Sentry&nbsp;use|
|---|---|
|**Userbase**|
|- how many users does the application have?|*Did not find*|
|- where are they from, geographically?|*Did not find*|
|- how many are frequent users?|*Did not find*|
|- is the the number of active users increasing, or declining?|*Did not find*|
|**Application health**|
|- is the application behaving as expected?|`Performance` > `Web Vitals`|
|- if there are deviations, what kind of OS / browser / connection / geography are those connected to?|*above* > (filter); plethora of them!|
|**Instrumentation**|
|- is a certain code block functioning on the field, as expected?|*n/a*|
|- how many users enter into a certain state / do a specific action (or chain of actions)?|*n/a*|

With Sentry, the Web Vitals are nicely available on a single page.

**Verdict**

Sentry is mostly focused on error monitoring, but the Web Vitals feature makes it worth mentioning also here. The tool is professional and has a useful free tier subset of features.

|||
|---|---|
|**Pros**|&nbsp;&nbsp;Dashboard design|
||&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice non-free features (eg. multiple, customizable dashboards)|
|**Cons**||



## Instrumentation API

You can explicitly add instrumentation to certain code blocks, and then get metrics of these to the performance dashboards.

- duration (as a distribution)
- counters (can be used for sub-block "lap times", by setting to a fractional value)
- attributes (for filtering)

The API available to your web app is:

```
# traces.js
const crunchyTrace = createTr("crunch");
```

```
# elsewhere
...
   const ct = crunchyTrace();		// starts the trace
   
   ct.setCounter("a counter", 2);
   ct.setAttribute("dalton", "Joe");

   ct.end();   
```

Such an instrumentation API is intended to give a common use pattern, regardless of the tools underneath. 


>Note: For Firebase Performance monitoring, *"each custom code trace can record up to 32 metrics (including the default Duration metric)"*. That means you can have at the most 31 counters, per trace.
