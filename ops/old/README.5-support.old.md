# Support forums

You have deployed the app. Made changes to it. Have users.

You have logs rolling and maybe have set up some alerts, to feel relaxed.

Now what?

I'd like to leave you with two thoughts, and some pointers to get discussion partners.

## 1. Managing yourself

It's easy to think things are only about technology. They are not! What matters to your users - and your success - is likely not the technical underpinnings, or even well planned features of your site / product.

It's what matters to your *users* that defines your product's success.

Invest in thinking like this. Be the manager. Read books that make you a better manager. Be gentle on yourself (and your colleagues, plus users). Try to have fun!

Recommended books:

## 2. Join the forums

It's always good to ask for advice. Here are some forums where people like you hang around. You can find the author of this repo in all of them:

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

  They single-handedly defined the modern Q/A site, and have been able to keep it relevant, interesting, clean and a generally rewarding experience!
  
- Firebase has a great [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/firebase/videos) that got splendid material during ~2019. Keep in mind not all of it applies to web, though.
  
- [Firebase Developers Discord server](https://discord.firebase.me/)     
  
  Community powered forum where you are likely to get fast, knowledgeable feedback to your questions - and/or able to help others. Be nice! Read the "welcome" instructions. :)

This is the end.
