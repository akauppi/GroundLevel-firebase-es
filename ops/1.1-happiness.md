# 1.1 User happiness

Under "user happiness" we focus on application health. It's fundamental to your users' experience that the application is available to them, loads consistently and does not crash when they use it.

These are hygiene metrics.

|||
|---|---|
|**User happiness**|
|- how snappy is the user experience?|Sentry > `Performance` > `Web Vitals`|
|- does it vary considerably over browsers / connection speeds / device types / geographies?|Sentry > `Performance` > `Web Vitals` > filters |
|- has the user experience become better/worse, over time?|(as above)|
|- are external endpoints (e.g. Firebase) responding in a healthy fashion?|<!--tbd.-->|
|- are any users experiencing anomalities?|Sentry > `Issues`|
|- if so, is there a common denominator (browser type, device type, geography, ...)?|Sentry > `Issues` > filters|

## Sentry

Doing a production build bakes in a Sentry JavaScript client that gathers information about page load<!--and network interactions-->, automatically. You only need to provide your own `SENTRY_DSN` value, as mentioned in [Setting up Sentry](./Setting up Sentry.md).


### What gets collected?

The Sentry JavaScript client picks up:

- [Web vitals](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/web-vitals/) (Sentry docs)
   - First Paint
   - First Contentful Paint
   - Cumulative Layout Shift
   - Largest Contentful Paint
   - First Input Delay (requires a polyfill for Firebase Performance Monitoring) 

   >Note: There are restrictions based on browser capabilities. For example (Aug 2022), Sentry does not collect LCP from Firefox and Safari.
   >
   >To check these, see Sentry > `Performance` > `Web Vitals` > `Worst LCP Web Vitals` > `View All`. 

- Errors; [Issues](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/) (Sentry docs)

   Cases where an exception within your web app code fell through any handlers.

### Automatic context

Sentry collects certain context automatically:

- browser type
- geographical location
- network speed
- ...		<!-- tbd. complete -->

For errors, it provides:
   
- stack trace
- breadcrumb trail (of user interactions and network calls) that lead to the event
- tags 
- browser type etc.

<!-- tbd. complete the list once we have more usage data -->

<!--
### What do you need to code?

Nothing, unless you want to.

You can add information to the collected web vitals and caught errors by the following APIs.

#### Tags

*tbd.*

<!-- tbd. list also the tags that GroundLevel automatically inserts
--_>

#### Breadcrumbs

*tbd.*
