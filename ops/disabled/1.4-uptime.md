# 1.4 Uptime monitoring

There are many products that provide you with "synthetic monitoring" or "uptime monitoring" solutions. Their servers will occasionally try to reach your app, and if they fail, report that to you.


## Question to ask

|||
|---|---|
|**Reachability**|
|- have my users been able to reach the app?|


## Uptime Robot

[Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com) is one of the few services providing a fully free tier (it has ads, though).


## Do I really need this?

No.

If you are hosting your web app on Firebase Hosting (as the template is set up to do), you can likely just rely that availability is guaranteed.

[Firebase Status Dashboard](https://status.firebase.google.com) shows if there have been any glitches during the last 7 days.

<!--
You can craft a small, scheduled task (think: shell script) that pings your site and fails if there's no reply (Cloud Functions or Cloud Run would be fine for this).
-->

Plus, if you have *any meaningful number of users*, you'd be seeing an outage in the number of users -charts and/or hearing about it in the users forum.
