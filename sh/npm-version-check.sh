# Context:
#   Interactive use of 'npm' (not CI)
#
# - npm 6 is incompatible with this project (no 'file:' support)
# - npm 7.6.x had some minor inconsistencies, so recommending 7.7.0+ (but allowing people to proceed)
#
# Requires:
#   - sort -C -V   (macOS ok; Ubuntu ok; Alpine NOT = CI skips this!)
#
_HAVE="$(npm --version)"
  # e.g. "7.9.0"
_WANT="7.7"
