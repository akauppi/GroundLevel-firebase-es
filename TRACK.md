## Firebase Crashlytics: Availability for web

- [ ] [FR: Crashlytics firebase](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/710) (GitHub issue; Apr 2018)

   Not available for web, as of <strike>May 2022</strike> Nov 2022.

   This has been a long-wished-for thing, but likely not surfacing any time soon. Let's keep looking, nonetheless.
   
   In the mean time, Grafana Faro should have these features, and if serverless framework becomes a selectable choice, there's so no need for this to come from Firebase. No need.
